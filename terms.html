          <h2 class="section-title">Company Identification</h2>

          <h2 class="section-title">Scope of Services</h2>
          <p>
            Services are provided based on written proposals, statements of work,
            estimates, or other agreed documentation. Site conditions, existing
            materials, access, and third-party coordination may impact the scope,
            schedule, or pricing. We reserve the right to adjust the scope and
            pricing when project conditions differ from assumptions at the time of
            estimation.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Estimates, Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>All estimates are non-binding and subject to change until accepted in writing.</li>
            <li>Pricing may be adjusted for scope changes, concealed conditions, or client-directed revisions.</li>
            <li>Invoices are due according to the terms outlined in the proposal or service agreement.</li>
            <li>Past-due balances may delay scheduling or completion of services.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-title">No Guarantee of Outcomes</h2>
          <p>
            We perform services in a professional and workmanlike manner; however,
            outcomes may vary based on site conditions, regulatory requirements,
            material conditions, and factors outside our control. We do not guarantee
            specific outcomes or timelines unless explicitly stated in writing.
          </p>

            any claim related to services is limited to the amount paid for the
            specific services giving rise to the claim.
          </p>
